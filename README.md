# Status of project

# tasks completed -

1. initial data aquired
2. Folder structure and repo initalization done (subject to change as main model gets built)
3. Initial Project Architecture plotted
4. Static loading of files completed
5. Max and Min plotted for each market and it's corresponding article plotted - plotted in ipynb file
6. Simple Moving average for all markets at 2weeks plotted - plots stored in separate plots/simple_moving folder
7. Corelation Matrix From 1st day to 1st week and 2nd week after the speech is delivered plotted - plotted in ipynb file
8. files all carried in snippets and put in snippets folder

# tasks pending -
1. 1st iteration Prediction model with train and test data 
2. creating a bert transformed test set to test the model after the inital training
